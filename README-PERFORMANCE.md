## Quick Start

### Step 1: Establish Baseline (15 minutes)
```bash
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Performance tab
3. Record interaction with canvas
4. Note frame time and FPS
5. Look for dropped frames (> 16ms)
```

### Step 2: Identify Your Scenario (5 minutes)
Use PERFORMANCE-DECISION-TREE.md to:
- Answer the quick decision flow questions
- Find your matching scenario
- See recommended solution stack

### Step 3: Apply Automatic Optimizations (1 hour)
From OPTIMIZATION-GUIDE.md:
- Enable GPU acceleration (canvas context flags)
- Implement RAF loop
- Apply transformation matrix once per frame
- Manage context state with single save/restore

**Expected Result**: 10-50x speedup

### Step 4: Profile Again (10 minutes)
If not at 60fps:
- Identify bottleneck using DevTools
- Note which operation is slow

### Step 5: Apply Targeted Optimization (2-8 hours)
From PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATION-DEEP-DIVE.md:
- Find your bottleneck section
- Copy code examples
- Implement optimization
- Profile before/after

**Expected Result**: Additional 2-40x speedup

### Step 6: Repeat Until 60fps
- Measure frame time again
- If still not 60fps, repeat Step 4-5
- Stop when diminishing returns reached

## Performance Metrics

### Key Indicators

**Healthy**:
- Frame time: 8-14ms
- FPS: 60 (consistent)
- Dropped frames: < 1 per minute
- Memory growth: < 10MB per 5 minutes

**Concerning**:
- Frame time: 16-32ms
- FPS: 30-60 (variable)
- Dropped frames: > 5 per minute
- Memory growth: > 50MB per 5 minutes

**Critical**:
- Frame time: > 32ms
- FPS: < 30
- Dropped frames: > 10 per minute
- Memory growth: > 100MB per 5 minutes

### Production Monitoring

```javascript
// Minimal monitoring setup
class Monitor {
  recordFrameTime(duration) {
    if (duration > 20) {
      analytics.track('slow_frame', { duration });
    }
  }
}

// Alert thresholds:
// - Frame time > 20ms for > 10 seconds
// - Memory growth > 50MB in 5 minutes
// - Dropped frames > 5 per minute
```

## Common Mistakes & Solutions

| Mistake | Impact | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Optimize before profiling | Wasted time | Always profile first |
| Reading pixels in render loop | 100x slowdown | Move getImageData outside |
| Too many save/restore calls | 5x slowdown | Batch transformations |
| Rendering invisible objects | 10-99x slowdown | Add viewport culling |
| Never clearing caches | Memory leak | Implement LRU eviction |
| Tile size too small | Overhead kills benefits | Use 256-512px tiles |
| Tile size too large | Visible loading delay | Use 128-256px tiles |
| Workers for simple ops | Slower due to overhead | Use only for complex ops |
| No performance monitoring | Can't catch issues | Add metrics collection |
| Premature micro-optimization | Complexity for 1% gain | Focus on major issues first |

## Decision Flow

```
START
  ↓
Measure baseline FPS
  ↓
FPS >= 60? ─ YES ─→ Monitor in production (DONE)
  ↓ NO
  ↓
How many objects?
  ├─ < 100       → Profile (likely not rendering bottleneck)
  ├─ 100-500     → State batching (1h, 2-5x)
  ├─ 500-2000    → Viewport culling (2h, 5-10x)
  ├─ 2000-10000  → Spatial indexing (4h, 10-40x)
  └─ > 10000     → Quadtree + advanced (6h, 10-50x)
  ↓
Canvas size?
  ├─ < 2000x2000   → Standard optimizations
  ├─ 2000x5000     → Consider tile-based
  └─ > 5000x5000   → Tile-based + workers
  ↓
Apply optimization
  ↓
Measure again
  ↓
FPS >= 60 and smooth? ─ YES ─→ DONE
  ↓ NO
  ↓
(Repeat)
```
